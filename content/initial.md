# Japan life

This media aims to introduce foreigner's life in Japan.

Japan, third's largest GDP in the world, has a lot of interesting charactors, beautiful sites, kind people.
They will be definately attractive for you.

But sometimes Japan is difficult for foreigners.
For example, renting house without any help of your family, school, company is suprisingly hard.
It means that living in Japan for working has some difficulity.
Japan still has the culture of "Hanko"
which is classic stump system for applying documents to banks, government office, and so on.
You will go mad when you asked "Do you have your own stump? It will prove who you are".

We want to help foreigners not to go mad facing these issues.
