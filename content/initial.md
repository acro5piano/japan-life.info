Japan, third's largest GDP in the world, has a lot of interesting charactors, beautiful sites, kind people.
They will be definately attractive for you.

# Its difficulty

Sometimes living in Japan is difficult for foreigners.

For example, renting house without any help of your family, school, company is surprisingly hard.
It means that living in Japan for working is sometimes difficult.

Also, Japan still has the culture of "Hanko",
which is the classic stump system for applying documents to banks, government office, and so on.
You will go mad when you are asked "Do you have your own stump?".

It will prove who you are in Japan.

We want to help foreigners not to go mad facing these issues.
